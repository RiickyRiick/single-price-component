## Overview

This project took me to complete in about 1 hour and 30min . This was one of my goals, in accomplishing the newbie projects in a timely manner. In additiion, I also figured out how to add my signature in the footer section. Overall execution was better than I anticipated, especialyl the timing of it. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

HTML: --Process began with grouping and naming the classes accordingly. --Double checking for any redundancy within the class names making sure everyhting makes sense semantically

CSS: --Began with the universal and body selectors assiging their respective values --used the CSS custom properties i.e., :root / var() --sized and positioned the main container --stylize the card design --proceeded to create the grid container, then the heaader and then footer --added all font weights, size and colors --finished with the buttons and their hover effects, and @media queries 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Surprisingly, there were no challenges within this project. I learned that finishing projects within a timeframe can open the doors to how well you know HTML and CSS. I started at 3-4 hours and reduced that now to 1 hour and 30 minutes. However, I prefer quality over quantity; quickness will eventually come.
